# Hi, welcome to my page!
- 👋 Hi, I’m @zsr-lukezhang.

- ⚡ Fun fact:
  - ✨ Windows 11 24H2 💻 has a bug that will stop the current system WinUI window's mica.
    - It can be done if you double-pressed the Win 🪟 key on your keyboard ⌨️.
    - The mica will return if you double-pressed the same key on your keyboard again!
  - 🌐 Example.com is a domain that anyone can use in their projects!
